## Motivation

This project was created for educational purposes. The main goal is to get familiar with the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and see how it feels to build a responsive UI using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

**1. Get the correct Node version for this project**

```bash
nvm install
```

**2. Generate the necessary environment variables**

```bash
npm run generate:env
```

**3. Setup a Spotify account**

This application is using the **Spotify Web API** under the hood, therefore you must create a Spotify user account (Premius or Free) to use it. To do that, simply sign up at [www.spotify.com](www.spotify.com).

When you have a user account, go to the [Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) page at the **Spotify Developer** website and, if necessary, log in. Accept the latest [Developer Terms of Service](https://developer.spotify.com/terms) to complete your account setup.

**4. Register this application**

The next step is to register this application following [these steps](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/).

**5. Provide credentials**

The last step is to provide the necessary `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` variables in the generated `.env` file.

### Installation

**1. Install all dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```
